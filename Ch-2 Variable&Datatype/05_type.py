t=type(a) #it give you type of a it is string so it give me 'str'
print(t)
b=30
t=type(b)
print(t) 
c="68"  # i write in"_" this so it become string
d=int(c) # here i channge the type of d
t=type(d) # here i print t which store type of  d which is become integer
print(t)
# a=3.14
# a=str(a)
# print(type(a))  here i convert float to string
